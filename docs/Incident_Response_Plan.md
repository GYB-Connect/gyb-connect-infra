# Disable compromised IAM user
aws iam put-user-policy --user-name $COMPROMISED_USER --policy-name DenyAll --policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Deny","Action":"*","Resource":"*"}]}'

# Rotate compromised access keys
aws iam create-access-key --user-name $USER
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name $USER --access-key-id $OLD_KEY

# Isolate EC2 instance (if applicable)
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID --groups sg-isolated

# Block IP address in WAF
aws wafv2 update-ip-set --scope CLOUDFRONT --id $IP_SET_ID --addresses $MALICIOUS_IP
```
