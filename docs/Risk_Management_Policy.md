# **GYB Connect Risk Management Policy**

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: January 2024  
**Review Date**: January 2025  
**Classification**: Internal Use Only

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

This Risk Management Policy establishes a systematic approach for identifying, assessing, and managing information security risks that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of cardholder data and supporting systems.

**Scope**: All business processes, systems, and technologies that handle, store, process, or transmit cardholder data or connect to the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE).

## **2. Risk Management Framework**

### **2.1 Risk Management Process**

Our risk management process follows a continuous cycle:

1. **Risk Identification**: Systematically identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities
2. **Risk Assessment**: Analyze the likelihood and impact of identified risks
3. **Risk Treatment**: Implement appropriate controls to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid risks
4. **Risk Monitoring**: Continuously monitor and review risks and control effectiveness
5. **Risk Communication**: Report risks to stakeholders and maintain risk awareness

### **2.2 Risk Governance**

**Risk Owner**: Chief Technology Officer (CTO)

- Ultimate accountability for risk management program
- Approval of risk treatment decisions
- Resource allocation for risk mitigation

**Risk Manager**: Security Team Lead

- Day-to-day risk management activities
- Risk assessments and analysis
- Risk register maintenance

**Risk Committee**: Executive team + Security team

- Quarterly risk review meetings

- Risk appetite and tolerance setting

## **3. Risk Assessment Methodology**

### **3.1 Risk Identification**

**Threat Sources**

- External threats (cybercriminals, nation-states, hacktivists)
- Internal threats (malicious insiders, negligent employees)
- Environmental threats (natural disasters, infrastructure failures)
- Technical threats (system failures, software vulnerabilities)

**Vulnerability Categories**

- Network vulnerabilities (firewall misconfigurations, open ports)
- System vulnerabilities (unpatched software, weak configurations)
- Application vulnerabilities (code flaws, injection attacks)
- Physical vulnerabilities (unauthorized access, equipment theft)
- Process vulnerabilities (inadequate procedures, human error)

**Asset Classification**

- **Critical**: Cardholder data, authentication systems, payment processing
- **High**: Customer data, financial records, administrative systems
- **Medium**: Business applications, employee data, internal communications
- **Low**: Public information, development systems, documentation

### **3.2 Risk Analysis**

**Likelihood Assessment**

- **Very High (5)**: >80% probability within 12 months
- **High (4)**: 60-80% probability within 12 months
- **Medium (3)**: 40-60% probability within 12 months
- **Low (2)**: 20-40% probability within 12 months
- **Very Low (1)**: <20% probability within 12 months

**Impact Assessment**

- **Very High (5)**: Catastrophic business impact, regulatory action, >$1M loss
- **High (4)**: Major business disruption, significant legal issues, $100K-$1M loss
- **Medium (3)**: Moderate business impact, compliance violations, $10K-$100K loss
- **Low (2)**: Minor business impact, internal issues, $1K-$10K loss
- **Very Low (1)**: Negligible impact, minimal business disruption, <$1K loss

**Risk Calculation**
Risk Level = Likelihood Ã— Impact

| Risk Score | Risk Level | Required Action |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| 20-25 | Critical | Immediate action required |
| 15-19 | High | Action required within 30 days |
| 10-14 | Medium | Action required within 90 days |
| 5-9 | Low | Monitor and review quarterly |
| 1-4 | Very Low | Accept risk or monitor annually |

## **4. Risk Treatment Strategies**

### **4.1 Risk Treatment Options**

**Mitigate**

- Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact
- Most common approach for operational risks
- Examples: Firewalls, encryption, access controls

**Transfer**

- Share risk with third parties
- Insurance, outsourcing, contracts
- Examples: Cyber insurance, cloud provider shared responsibility

**Accept**

- Acknowledge risk and continue operations
- Appropriate for low-level risks
- Requires formal acceptance and documentation

**Avoid**

- Eliminate the risk by changing business processes
- Remove vulnerable systems or processes
- Examples: Discontinue risky services, change technology

### **4.2 Control Categories**

**Preventive Controls**

- Prevent security incidents from occurring
- Examples: Firewalls, access controls, encryption
- Priority for high-likelihood risks

**Detective Controls**

- Identify security incidents when they occur
- Examples: Monitoring, logging, intrusion detection
- Essential for sophisticated threats

**Corrective Controls**

- Respond to and recover from security incidents
- Examples: Backup systems, incident response, business continuity
- Critical for business resilience

**Compensating Controls**

- Alternative controls when standard controls aren't feasible
- Must provide equivalent protection
- Require PCI DSS QSA approval

## **5. Risk Appetite and Tolerance**

### **5.1 Risk Appetite Statement**

GYB Connect maintains a **conservative risk appetite** for information security risks that could impact cardholder data security or business operations. We prioritize security over convenience and will invest in appropriate controls to maintain this posture.

### **5.2 Risk Tolerance Levels**

**Zero Tolerance**

- Unauthorized access to cardholder data
- Non-compliance with PCI DSS requirements

- Non-critical system outages
- Internal process inefficiencies

### **5.3 Risk Escalation Thresholds**
