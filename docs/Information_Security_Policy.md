## **2. Policy Statement**

GYB Connect is committed to maintaining the highest standards of information security to protect cardholder data and maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) v4.0. We implement a comprehensive security program based on the principles of defense in depth, least privilege access, and continuous monitoring.

## **4. Core Security Principles**

### **4.1 Defense in Depth**

Multiple layers of security controls protect against threats:

- Network security controls (firewalls, WAF, VPC)
- Application security (secure coding, input validation)
- Data protection (encryption, access controls)
- Monitoring and detection (logging, alerting, SIEM)

### **4.2 Principle of Least Privilege**

- Users and systems receive the minimum access necessary
- Regular access reviews ensure permissions remain appropriate
- Privileged access requires additional controls and monitoring

### **4.3 Zero Trust Architecture**

- No implicit trust based on network location
- Continuous verification of identity and device state
- Micro-segmentation and encrypted communications

## **5. Security Requirements**

### **5.1 Network Security**

- Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) must be segmented from other networks
- All network access to CDE requires explicit authorization
- Firewall rules follow deny-all, permit-by-exception principle
- Network activity is logged and monitored continuously

### **5.2 Data Protection**

- All cardholder data must be encrypted in transit and at rest
- Customer-managed encryption keys with annual rotation
- Data retention limits strictly enforced
- Secure deletion procedures for end-of-life data

### **5.3 Access Control**
